        "Currently this is not possible in Switzerland. The Federal Council (Bundesrat) wants to change that. A legal basis is needed for the collection, storage and processing of PNR data. The Federal Council has instructed the Department of Justice and Police (EJPD), together with the Department of Transport (Uvek), to prepare a consultation draft for a law on the collection and use of such data.",
        "Even tough it is currently not possible in Switzerland, already 24 European countries have established agencies to collect, store and process these PNR data. This means if you fly to EU countries your data will be collected."

        "The PNR Directive (EU) regulates the transfer of such PNR data to the law enforcement authorities of the Member States and their processing for the purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious crime.",
        "The European Parliament and the Council agreed on a compromise text in December 2015. The European Parliament adopted its position on April 14, 2016. The Council subsequently adopted the directive on April 21, 2016. Member States had two years to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.",
        "A possible implementation of this directive can be seen, for example, in Germany's Air Passenger Data Act."
